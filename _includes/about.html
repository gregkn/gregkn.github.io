                    <p class="text-muted">I am lucky enough to live in San Francisco, not more than two miles from where I grew up. I live with my Australian Labradoodle, Kugel and fianc√© Nadia. I love to cook and I spend a good portion of my spare time cooking; I find that cooking is a great way to wind down after a long day. </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">When I'm not cooking, I am watching Bravo, playing with Kugel, seeking out the best new restaurant in SF, or planning my next trip.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Photographer</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">I love both taking photographs as well as looking at the works of others. I shoot in both analog and digital. In high school I developed a passion for film photography using Brownie cameras. I picked up a few from eBay and antique stores and restored them to like-new condition. I have taken some of my favorite photos on my Brownie Hawkeye.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">IT Enthusiast</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">Ever since I broke my first computer at the ripe age of seven, my passion to fix them has grown. A natural-born tinkerer, I enjoy learning about how things work as well as finding new and creative ways for technology to solve problems. My IT career began in middle school when I would stay after school to repair iBook G3s that were constantly battered by my peers and it has only grown from there. </p>

                    <p class="text-muted">I have been diving for almost as long as I can remember - probably since I was 10 years old. I love SCUBA diving because it is such a freeing experience; it's just you and the rest of the ocean. When I'm on a scooter, it's the closest I've come to flying. My favorite type of diving is wreck diving where you can see how nature has taken over a piece of history. I hold multiple certifications with PADI including Advanced Open Water, Enriched Air Diving, and Underwater Photography. </p>
